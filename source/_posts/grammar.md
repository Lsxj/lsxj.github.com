# 系动词 主系表句型
## 系动词： 
* 在句子中作为谓语，没有实际意思。
* 表达主语性质
* 是否可以用“是，为”来翻译.
## 系动词分类
### be 动词 （am, is, are）
be动词后有三大表语： 
* 名词 `I am a girl.`；
* 形容词 `The play was very interesting.`；  (介词短语可以作为形容词： `The milk is in the refrigerator.`)；
* **地点**副词 `My bedroom is downstairs.`
### 状态保持动词 （keep, remain, stay）
后面只能加**形容词**做表语，和be无缝切换。
`You should keep quiet!` or `You should be quiet!`
`No one can remain youthful forever.`
`The weather stayed fine for a week.`
### 状态转变动词
* become 变成+名词。 变得+形容词。
`He became a teacher.`
`He became very nervous.`
* get 变得+形容词 
`He got very angry.`
* go 走，去，变坏 
`The meat always goes bad in summer.`
* come 来，变好
`Thing will come right.`
* grow 慢慢变化
`The weather grew cold in the night.`
* turn 快速变化
`His face turned pale.`
### 感官动词 （look, sound, smell, taste, feel）
后面接**形容词**作表语。
`He looked very angry.`
如果后面要加名词，感官动词+**介词like**+名词
`The sun looks like an orange global.`

## Practice

# 不及物动词- 主谓
不及物动词 vi。不需要加宾语就可以构成完整的句子。
如何判断及物还是不及物。在动词前面加“被”。
正常--及物动词（被打，被处罚）
不正常--不及物动词（被跳舞，被做梦）
一般后面都会加状语。

## Practice

# 不完全及物动词 -- 主谓宾宾补
不完全及物动词，加了宾语后意思仍不完整，还需要加上补语。
补语：补充说明宾语的动作或状态。
一般是使役动词。（make,have,let,get）
使……做…… 
## 句型
make/have/let + 宾语 + 动词原形（补语）
get + 宾语 + 动词不定式 （补语）
`I made him wash the car.`
`I got him to wash the car`
宾语和补语可以组成一个完整的句子。
`he wash the car`

# 授予动词--主谓双宾
give, send, tell, teach, pay, show, offer
`I send him a book`
双宾： him， book
`The scientist told us many stories.`
双宾： us, stories

# 主谓宾宾补 vs 主谓双宾
如果谓语的动作，作用于两个不同名词，即两个宾语，则是主谓双宾的句型。
主谓宾补，补语是宾语的动作或状态。
